# Title
  quiz-application

# About
  
  This project is a Windows Forms application developed using Visual Studio Community Edition 2022. I designed this application in order to both practice foundational software development skills and to demonstrate those skills to others. Developing this project has given me the opportunity to grow in my knowledge of C#, Object-Oriented Programming, WinForms, application and database design and integration, writing sql queries, implementing stored procedures, and backing up my code using Git and GitHub.
  
# Usage 
  
  This application allows users to create multiple-choice quizzes. The title, length, and content of those quizzes is based upon user input. Once created, a quiz is stored in a database and displayed on the home page. From the home page, users can also choose to take previously created quizzes and are shown their results upon the quiz's completion.
